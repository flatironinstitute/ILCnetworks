# ILC regulatory network explorer

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/flatironinstitute/ILCnetworks/master)

Interactive visualization of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) and gene expression heatmaps from
Pokrovskii,... Miraldi et al. (2019) "Transcriptional regulatory networks that promote and restrict 
identities and functions of intestinal innate lymphoid cells".

This repository uses Jupyter notebooks to interactively visualize TRNs and gene expression heatmaps 
with [jp_gene_viz](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/jp_gene_viz)

A [step-by-step ILC network visualization guide](ref/step-by-step-ILCnetwork_viz_guide.pdf) is available.

This repository is designed to either run in the cloud using 
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/flatironinstitute/ILCnetworks/master)
or locally in a encapsulated container using
[`repo2docker`](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to build and run a `docker` container which includes
the code for running the analysis and all needed dependencies.
The `repo2docker` tool requires the `docker` infrastructure
and Python 3 to run.  See the 
[installation instructions](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

To build and run the docker image from the command line

```bash
jupyter-repo2docker https://github.com/flatironinstitute/ILCnetworks
```
